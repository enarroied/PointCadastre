ENGLISH - This plugin duplocates a layer of Points and adds to its features information from the French land registry. Points located outside of France or outside of property (for example, a main road or a river) will be duplicated but no property information cann be added... Be aware of the fact that some (very few) towns in France have not been vectorized yet and no information from those towns will be added to the features. 
FRANÇAIS - Ce projet QGIS associe les données cadastrales de chaque point d'une couche (de points...)
